This is a very basic web app I was playing around with to learn React Context and Hooks.

I have nested context and hooks for the first time, as well as introducing a dark/light theme toggle.

I am currently working on a fully fledged to-do app at https://github.com/jonnowelch/task-app.git if you want to see my progress.
